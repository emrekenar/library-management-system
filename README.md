Library Management System is an interactive, lite, web-based application for libraries. Publishers can request their books to be added to the system. Library users can search, filter, reserve and put a hold request on books. Finally, library managers can edit books on the system, lend books to the users and track users' penalties. Library users can create accounts on the system whereas accounts of library managers and publishers must be created in the database.
